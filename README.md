<p align="center">
  <b>A Work-in-Progress 3D platformer inspired by The Binding of Isaac and Super Mario 64.</b><br>
  This project aims to combine the procedural level generation mechanics of <b>The Binding of Isaac</b> 
  with the exploration and platforming feel of <b>Super Mario 64</b>, creating a unique 3D gameplay experience.

<h2>ðŸ“Š Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  The game features procedural level generation, where rooms and platforms are created dynamically.  
  Players navigate, jump, and explore 3D environments while facing challenges inspired by roguelike design.  
  The mechanics are designed to be flexible, allowing future expansion with enemies, power-ups, and collectibles.
</p>

<h2>ðŸ“‹ Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Procedurally generated 3D rooms and platforms</li>
  <li>Platforming mechanics inspired by Super Mario 64</li>
  <li>Exploration and replayability elements from roguelike design</li>
  <li>Dynamic camera controls for 3D navigation</li>
  <li>Work-in-progress: modular systems for items, enemies, and traps</li>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸ§­ How to Play / Build</h2>
<p>
